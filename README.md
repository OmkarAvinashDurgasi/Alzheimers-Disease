# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Predictor


   This Project is implemented by using Machine Learning Algorithms to predict whether a patient is effected with Alzheimers Disease or not by using the MRI scanning data from the file longitudinal.csv file from Kaggle. Alzheimers is a brain disorder, that effects human memory, thinking capacity in such a way that the person cannot perform even a simple task. Alzheimer's usually starts after age 60. The risk increases as the person ages. The risk of having this disease is greater if there are people in the family who have had this disease. As for the treatments that have been done for this disease, there is none that can stop the progress of this. So far what these treatments can achieve is to help alleviate some symptoms, reducing their intensity and contributing to a higher quality of life for patients and their families. Implementation of classification algorithms for the analysis of the medical dataset, in order to provide a prediction tool for the early diagnosis of the disease.
                            By implementing classification algorithms for the analysis of the medical dataset, in order to provide a prediction tool for the early diagnosis of the disease. We will use different machine learning algorithms for predicting Alzheimer's disease. A comparison of this execution is taken into account to determine which algorithm works better for given dataset in terms of metrics like precision, recall, accuracy and F1 score.
 
Steps:
First, we must upload the dataset and apply the pre-processing techniques.
We describe the total number of parameters in the model.
Then we train the model with the dataset by using different machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Ada Boost, Extra Trees, Gradient Boost, Support Vector Machine (SVM).
To evaluate the process, we use metrics like precision, recall, accuracy and F1 score. This project is implemented using python and anaconda tools.
